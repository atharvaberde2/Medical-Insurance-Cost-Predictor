# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Predictor
In this project, I developed and trained Random Forest Regressor, and a Pipeline of Polynomial Features and Ridge Regression to predict medical insurance bills using a dataset containing various patient features. These features included age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Data Visualization were performed to interpret the data and ensure efficient preprocessing. Before training the data, I split the data into 70% training and 30% testing to ensure a fair evaluation. Training the data using Random Forest Regressor achieved an 83% validation accuracy, and training the data using a pipeline of Polynomial Features, and Ridge Regression achieved an accuracy of 83.7%. I ran K Fold through the pipeline of Polynomial Features, and Ridge Regression model to assess the model's performance across different subsets of the data. The mean accuracy from this validation was 83.1%, demonstrating the model's consistency.
